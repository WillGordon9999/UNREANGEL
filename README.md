# Setup
- Start by copying UNREANGEL to your project's Plugins folder
- Find your UProject file, right-click on it, and select Generate Project Files
- Open your IDE, and compile the project

```
Please Note, there is a current limitation where you will have to compile twice before the plugin works
1st compilation may take several minutes and will fail because it has to update various dependencies after Unreal Build Tool has already run
2nd compilation should take around 1 minute, and should succeed since the dependencies should not change
```

- Once you have compiled you can find the VS Code Extension for Unreal Angelscript Support here: https://github.com/Hazelight/vscode-unreal-angelscript
- Now open your project, and navigate to Tools > Open Angelscript Workspace (VS Code)
- For additional information you can refer to the original fork here: https://angelscript.hazelight.se/
